# terra-parity

This extension is made to improve development experience, quality and productivity when working with infrastructure as code such as terragrunt setups.

## Align environments

In infrastructure as code repositories, the folder structure frequently is organized around cloud services accounts where resources are provisioned and environments - development, staging, production etc. See https://docs.gruntwork.io/foundations/iac-foundations/folder-structure/

Another commom practice is to keep environments similar as much as possible for reproducibility - https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity.

*Align environments* helps to quickly find, compare and align corresponding resources on different environments.



Whenever you work on IaC that follows above two principles, for aligning of corresponding resources on different environments, it's handy to be able to quickly find and compare files from different folders.
